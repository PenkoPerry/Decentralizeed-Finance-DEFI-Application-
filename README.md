# Description 

Objective
The goal of this task is to develop a DeFi application that enables users to lend and borrow tokens with dynamically calculated interest rates. This project aims to provide a transparent, trustless, and user-friendly platform for decentralized lending and borrowing, inspired by popular DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.

Key Features of the DeFi Application
Lending & Borrowing System

Users can supply liquidity by depositing tokens into the lending pool.
Borrowers can take loans against collateral.
Smart contracts manage interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.
Dynamic Interest Rate Calculation

Interest rates increase when demand is high (low liquidity).
Interest rates decrease when supply is high (high liquidity).
Collateralization & Liquidation

Users must deposit collateral to borrow assets.
If the collateral value drops below a threshold, liquidation occurs to protect lenders.
Smart Contracts Implementation

Lending Pool Contract: Handles deposits, withdrawals, and lending logic.
Borrowing Contract: Manages borrowing, interest accumulation, and repayments.
Liquidation Contract: Ensures over-collateralized loans remain secure.
Security & Transparency

Uses decentralized price oracles (e.g., Chainlink) for accurate pricing.
Smart contract audits to prevent flash loan attacks and vulnerabilities.
User-Friendly Frontend (Web3 Integration)

Built using React.js & Web3.js for easy interaction.
Connects with MetaMask & WalletConnect.
Displays real-time lending and borrowing stats.
Development Steps
Smart Contract Development (Solidity, Hardhat/Foundry)

Write & deploy LendingPool.sol, Borrowing.sol, and InterestRateModel.sol.
Test using Ganache or Ethereum Testnets (Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai).
Frontend & Web3 Integration (React, Ethers.js, Web3.js)

Develop a clean and intuitive UI for deposits, withdrawals, and borrowing.
Connect with smart contracts using Web3 libraries.
Testing & Deployment

Test contract functionality using unit tests in Hardhat.
Deploy to Ethereum, Polygon, or BSC Testnet.
Perform security checks & gas optimizations.
Challenges & Solutions
Challenges	Solutions
Interest Rate Model Complexity	Use a dynamic rate model based on utilization ratio.
Price Manipulation Risks	Integrate Chainlink Oracles for accurate price feeds.
Smart Contract Security Risks	Conduct audit & penetration testing before mainnet launch.
User Experience (UX) Issues	Build a simplified, intuitive frontend for easy interaction.
